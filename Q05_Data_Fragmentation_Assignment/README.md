# Message Fragmentation Program

## Overview

This project simulates message fragmentation and logs message fragments to a file. The program takes three command-line arguments:
1. Number of messages
2. Maximum message length (in bytes)
3. Channel width (in bytes)

The program uses a logging mechanism to record the message ID, fragment ID, and message body in the `message_log.txt` file located in the `docs/` directory.

### Source Files
- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the program, handling command-line arguments and execution.
- **MessageGenerator.cpp/hpp**: Generates and fragments messages.
- **Log.cpp/hpp**: Handles logging of messages and fragments.
- **Fragment.cpp/hpp**, **Header.cpp/hpp**, **Footer.cpp/hpp**, **Message.cpp/hpp**: Implements components of the message structure.

## Prerequisites

### Linux:
- `g++` compiler (GCC)
- `make` tool
- Ensure you have permission to write files to the `docs/` directory.

### Windows:
- MinGW or Cygwin installed for Unix-like `make` compatibility.
- `g++` compiler and `make` tool.

## Compilation and Execution

### Step 1: Clone or download the project
If you haven't already, clone this repository or download it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### Step 2: Build the program
Use the Makefile to compile the project.
On Linux:
```bash
make
```

On Windows:
```bash
make
```

### Step 3: Run the program
After compiling, you can run the program by using the make run command with the required arguments.
Linux and Windows:
```bash
make run ARGS="2 64 100"
```
This command runs the program with 2 messages, 64 bytes of maximum message length, and channel width of 100 bytes. Adjust these values as needed.

### Step 4: View the log
The program will log message fragments in the docs/message_log.txt file. You can view the log using a text editor.

### Clean up
After running the program, you can clean up the build files using the make clean command.
```bash
make clean
```

### Run unit tests
You can run the unit tests using the make test command.
```bash
make test
```

## Troubleshoting
- File Not Found Errors: Ensure your current working directory is the project root when running the make commands.
- Permission Denied Errors: Ensure you have permission to write to the docs/ directory.
- Windows Issues: Ensure you have a proper environment like MinGW or Cygwin for handling Unix-like commands in Windows.
